# ⛽ Fuel Efficiency Predictor and Optimization Assistant
This Streamlit-based web app uses a machine learning model (XGBoost) to predict a car’s fuel efficiency (KM/L) based on engine and performance parameters like acceleration, displacement, weight, horsepower, and cylinders.

It goes beyond just prediction by integrating LLM-powered AI suggestions using the LLaMA 4 Maverick model via OpenRouter to recommend actionable car modifications for improving fuel economy — including changes to engine specs, transmission, and fuel systems.
